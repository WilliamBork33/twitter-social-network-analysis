# twitter-social-network-analysis

Models and network graphs for a social network analysis project investigating a hashtag on Twitter. Script uses the Amen R package for analysis of network and dyadic data.

Models are saved as .RData files. Network graphs are .html files. The SNAscript.R file loads the pre-built node list and edge list. Then creates and runs the network graph which can be seen in the RStudio viewer window. Network graph can also be viewed in a web browser. Finally, the script provides model summaries. Models can also be modified, re-run, saved as well.
